About Dataset
Context
This is the dataset of our work where the application of portable Raman spectroscopy coupled with several supervised machine-learning techniques, is used to discern between diabetic patients (DM2) and healthy controls (Ctrl), with a high degree of accuracy.

Content
The 4 CSV files contain the average of five Raman spectroscopy scans at 12 cm-1 resolution collected at different skin sites, such as the left earlobe, left inner arm, left thumbnail and left median cubital vein, with approximately 15 s total exposure time.
